Bash script for checking IP addresses, the corresponding login and password.
* list_ip -> list of IP
* list_users -> list of possible users
* list_passwd -> list of possible passwords
* correct_data -> after executing the script, the login and password addresses will be correct

This script can help if you have a lot of Linux servers and you know the login and password, 
but don't remember which host they correspond to.
